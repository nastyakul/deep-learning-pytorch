# Deep Learning with Pytorch :computer:

This repository contains material related to [Udacity's Deep Learning with Pytorch course](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-pytorch--ud188) that I took. It consists of a bunch of tutorial notebooks for various deep learning topics with exercises completed by me. The course touched upon implementing models such as convolutional networks, recurrent networks, and GANs. 

Here's one of the most fun exercises of the course: style transfer!
